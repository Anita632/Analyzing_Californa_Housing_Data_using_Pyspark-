##  Data Analysis Key Findings

- The **top 10 spatial regions** by median house value all report a value of **$500,001**, indicating a **capped house value** in the dataset.

- Median income distribution varies significantly across **housing age buckets**, with clear differences observed in mean, standard deviation, and income range for each age group.

- The **correlation between median income and median house value** changes across income buckets:
  - Negative correlation in the lowest income bucket (**-0.1485**)
  - Strong positive correlation in the highest income bucket (**0.5323**)

- **Outliers in rooms-per-household** were detected using the **z-score method**, highlighting properties with unusually high or low room density.

- The **average bedrooms-to-rooms ratio** was computed for each spatial region, providing insights into housing structure composition.

- **Population density** was approximated per spatial bin, revealing how population is distributed across geographic grids.

- **Year-over-year growth analysis** and temporal trend analysis could not be performed due to the absence of a `year` column in the dataset.

- Splitting median house values into **deciles** revealed how key features—such as median income, total rooms, population, households, and housing age—vary across price segments.

- Comparison of **younger (<30 years)** versus **older (≥30 years)** houses showed that **older houses have a higher average price per room (~132.37)**.

- **Regression residual analysis** identified specific geographic areas (latitude–longitude based) that appear **overvalued or undervalued** relative to model predictions.

- An **affordability index** (median income ÷ median house value) was calculated for each spatial region to assess relative affordability.

- **K-Means clustering** grouped properties into distinct clusters, each showing clear differences in average income, population, and housing characteristics.

- The **average house value difference between nearest neighboring blocks** was approximately **$43,403**, indicating notable local price variation.

- A **moving average of median house values along longitude** revealed spatial price trends across California.

- Analysis across **population density buckets** showed:
  - Highest average house values in **Medium density**
  - Followed by **High density**, then **Low density**

- **Pearson correlation analysis** showed:
  - Strong correlation between house value and median income (**~0.69**)
  - Weak correlation between house value and total bedrooms (**~0.046**)
  - Suggesting house values are more sensitive to income than bedroom count

- A **histogram of housing median age** highlighted the distribution of properties across defined age ranges.

- **Variance in house values by income decile** was computed to assess price dispersion within income groups.

- A framework was implemented to compare **border vs interior blocks** within spatial regions, enabling analysis of potential **edge effects** in housing prices.
